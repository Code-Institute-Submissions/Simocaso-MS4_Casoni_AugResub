## Design

### Colour Scheme  
Through all site, I decided to keep a dark grey team so that the users could already experience a GYM environment, reconnecting the website to the colour of iron. In contrast, you will also see a nice bootstrap info color (#0dcaf0) to find what to do next in your current page quickly!

### Typography

Biotif, combined with the classic bootstrap font, was used throughout the project to help the overall design looking user-friendly.

### Imagery

The images used throughout the site were taken from https://unsplash.com/

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the site were created in balsamiq and uploaded as a pdf. They can be found as a pdf file [here.](https://github.com/Simocaso/MS4_Casoni/blob/master/wireframes)
